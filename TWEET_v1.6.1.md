## Alternative (More Technical)

🚀 Vreme v1.6.1 ships personalized temporal awareness for Claude

New features:
✅ 3 behavior analysis MCP tools
✅ Session phase detection (warming_up → focused → deep_work)
✅ Sleep pattern recognition (2.5+ hrs, 10pm-6am)
✅ Lunch break detection (30+ min, 11am-2pm)
✅ Timezone context for all patterns
✅ Dual storage: temporal + behavior contexts
✅ Privacy-first (local ~/.vreme/ only)

Claude adapts to your work style, not the other way around.

## Alternative (Feature Focus)

Shipped: Vreme v1.6.1 🧠

Claude can now:
• Know if you're in deep work or warming up
• Analyze your peak productivity hours
• Predict when you'll be back from breaks
• Understand your sleep/wake patterns
• Detect lunch breaks (culturally aware!)
• Detect timezone changes (travel awareness)

All local. All private. All for better AI collaboration.

Work til 3am → Say "tomorrow" → Claude knows you mean after sleep, not calendar date.

npm i @vreme/temporal-mcp
